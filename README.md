GPT-3 Supported Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Sourcing Project

Inspired by the inefficiencies in the sourcing processes for venture capital / private equity, I'm working on a project supported by GPT-3 to
produce semi-personalized emails to founders from building insightful summaries using information stored in webpage descriptor tags.

Data is stored relationally in MySQL and is scraped from a variety of sources. GPT-3 is then trained on this business description data, and the
project attempts to accumulate the dataset of businesses looking for funding.
